"""
As a comparison point for my initial solver (implemented in solver.py),
I wanted to implement a smaller, simpler, and more human-understandable
approach for selecting guesses - simply pick two words that, between them,
contain the 10 most-common letters in the corpus. Using those for the first
two guesses will give a good cross-section of information, from which a human
(or another algorithmic process) should be able to guess the actual answer
fairly quickly.

  # the 10 most-common letters, we first trim to only the guesses that are composed of those letters.

  # Since the next step is going to be O(n^2) on those guesses, this should result in a pretty significant speed-up

  # would have taken several minutes to complete)

  # we can explore that if the product-checking is still infeasibly slow)
